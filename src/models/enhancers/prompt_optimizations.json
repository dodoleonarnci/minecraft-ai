{
    "building": "MINECRAFT HOUSE BUILDING OPTIMIZATION:\n- Always begin with !newAction to clearly separate building tasks.\n- Before building, ensure you have all required materials; check storage with !viewChest and retrieve items with !takeFromChest.\n- If the player has materials you need, use !goToPlayer and request them; return excess using !givePlayer or !putInChest.\n- Use !goToPlayer to stay near the build site if the player is guiding placement.\n- Use !placeHere to place blocks precisely at your current position; repeat as needed for multi-block structures.\n- When constructing multi-layer builds, reposition between placements but continue using !placeHere for final placement.\n- If materials run out mid-build, return to the nearest chest with !viewChest and restock using !takeFromChest.\n- Use chests strategically: offload extra items with !putInChest to keep inventory manageable.\n- When collaborating with the player, use !goToPlayer periodically so builds occur at the correct location.\n- For large builds, break the process into multiple !newAction segments to maintain clarity.\n\n",
    
    "crafting": "MINECRAFT CRAFTING OPTIMIZATION:\n- Start crafting workflows with !newAction to isolate them.\n- Use !viewChest to inspect ingredient availability; retrieve items with !takeFromChest.\n- If ingredients are missing, consider whether the player may hold them; use !goToPlayer for item handoff.\n- When crafting finished items directly for the player, deliver results with !givePlayer.\n- Use !craftRecipe for crafting table recipes, survival recipes, or any known craftable item.\n- Use !smeltItem for furnace processes like ores or food; ensure the required inputs and fuel are acquired using !viewChest and !takeFromChest.\n- When crafting multiple items with shared ingredients, gather all required materials in one retrieval step to avoid repeated chest trips.\n- If your inventory becomes cluttered, store excess using !putInChest before crafting more.\n- When organizing workflows, treat smelting and crafting as distinct sub-tasks and start a new !newAction if needed.\n- After crafting, clarify where the output should go: give to the player, store in chest, or hold in inventory for next steps.\n\n",
    
    "traveling": "MINECRAFT TRAVELING OPTIMIZATION:\n- Always begin mobility tasks with !newAction.\n- Use !goToPlayer for point-to-point movement, especially when the player is the destination or waypoint.\n- Use !followPlayer for dynamic movement where you must keep pace with the player over time.\n- Prefer !followPlayer when the player is exploring, fleeing danger, or leading you to a remote location.\n- Use !goToPlayer after losing track of the player to reestablish proximity.\n- Maintain awareness of terrain changes; traveling tasks may require repositioning periodically with !goToPlayer.\n- When assigned to escort or accompany a player for long distances, rely primarily on !followPlayer to adapt continuously.\n- Use !newAction again if the travel objective changes (e.g., moving to a new biome, switching from escort to guard behavior).\n\n",
    
    "hunting": "MINECRAFT HUNTING OPTIMIZATION:\n- Begin with !newAction to cleanly start hunting logic.\n- Use !searchForEntity to locate target animals or hostile mobs; repeat if targets move or despawn.\n- Equip appropriate weapons or armor with !equip before engaging in combat.\n- Use !goToPlayer if the player is leading you toward the hunting area or if you need combat assistance.\n- Once the target is located, engage with !attack; repeat until the target is neutralized.\n- For multiple enemies, alternate between !searchForEntity and !attack to maintain situational awareness.\n- Use !equip to switch weapons depending on mob type (e.g., ranged vs melee threats).\n- If the player is assisting in combat, stay close using !goToPlayer between engagements.\n- When low on space, consider offloading loot with !putInChest after combat.\n- Start a new !newAction after hunting if transitioning to looting, crafting, or traveling.\n\n",
    
    "conversing": "MINECRAFT CONVERSING OPTIMIZATION:\n- Begin dialogue-oriented tasks with !newAction.\n- Use !startConversation to formally begin speaking with a player.\n- Record key details or commitments using !remember, especially if they define future goals or promised actions.\n- Use !goal to establish objectives for the conversation or tasks that arise from it; close them with !endGoal when finished.\n- Use !givePlayer if the conversation involves providing items (gifts, quest rewards, tools, etc.).\n- If discussing chest contents or item logistics, refer to !viewChest to inspect items during the conversation.\n- Use !endConversation when the discussion has concluded to clearly mark the end of dialogue mode.\n- Avoid mixing conversation with combat or crafting; start a new !newAction if switching contexts.\n- If the conversation leads to a new mission or task category, close the conversation with !endConversation before acting.\n\n",
    
    "collecting": "MINECRAFT COLLECTING OPTIMIZATION:\n- Start collection tasks with !newAction for clarity.\n- Use !searchForBlock to locate specific resources; repeat scanning if the environment changes.\n- Always use !equip to select the correct tool before breaking blocks (pickaxe, shovel, axe, etc.).\n- Use !collectBlocks to gather blocks on the surface or within easy reach.\n- For underground or deeper resources, use !digDown before collecting; ensure you may need repeated dig/collect cycles.\n- Switch tools frequently with !equip depending on block hardness and efficiency requirements.\n- After collecting a large quantity of resources, store items with !putInChest to free inventory.\n- If the player is guiding the collection route, maintain proximity via !goToPlayer.\n- Use !viewChest and !takeFromChest when you need spare tools, torches, or inventory space.\n- Break long collection missions into smaller segments with !newAction to prevent tool misuse or inventory overflow.\n\n",
    
    "surviving": "MINECRAFT SURVIVING OPTIMIZATION:\n- Start survival logic with !newAction to maintain priority.\n- Use !consume whenever hunger or health restoration is required.\n- Equip armor, weapons, or shield with !equip based on current threats.\n- Use !attack to defend against hostile mobs; use !attackPlayer only when survival tasks explicitly require PvP defense.\n- If overwhelmed, use !goToPlayer to regroup or retreat toward a safer ally.\n- Use !goToBed to safely skip nighttime or reset spawn if needed.\n- Use !viewChest, !takeFromChest, and !putInChest to manage emergency supplies like food, weapons, or tools.\n- Switch equipment dynamically with !equip depending on changing survival needs.\n- Use !newAction again when transitioning from survival back to normal tasks like crafting or traveling.\n- Prioritize safety over efficiency; pause other tasks if survival threatens to fail."
