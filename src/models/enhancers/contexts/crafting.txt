CRAFTING CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION:

Focus on creating items, tools, and processing materials. When crafting:
- Check if you have the required ingredients.
- Use a crafting table or furnace if needed.
- Manage inventory and storage.
- **CRITICAL**: If you are missing ingredients, DO NOT just say you can't craft it. IMMEDIATELY go collect them using `!collectBlocks`.
