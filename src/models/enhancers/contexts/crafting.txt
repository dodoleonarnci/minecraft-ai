CRAFTING CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION:

Focus on creating items, tools, and processing materials. When crafting:
- Check if you have the required ingredients.
- Use a crafting table or furnace if needed.
- Manage inventory and storage.
- **CRITICAL**: If you are missing ingredients, DO NOT just say you can't craft it. IMMEDIATELY go collect them using `!collectBlocks`.

Key Commands:
- !craftRecipe("item_name", num) - Craft items.
- !smeltItem("item_name", num) - Cook food or smelt ores in a furnace.
- !craftable - List items you can currently craft.
- !getCraftingPlan("item_name", quantity) - Check what ingredients you need.
- !inventory - Check your items.
- !viewChest - Look inside a nearby chest.
- !putInChest("item_name", num) - Store items.
- !takeFromChest("item_name", num) - Retrieve items.
- !clearFurnace - Retrieve items from a furnace.

Related Commands:
- !collectBlocks("type", num) - Gather missing ingredients (wood, stone, ores).
- !searchForBlock("type", range) - Find crafting tables or furnaces if you don't have one.

Tips:
- Use `!getCraftingPlan` to see exactly what you are missing.
- **If you need wood, stone, or ores, use `!collectBlocks` immediately.**
- Ensure you have a crafting table placed nearby for complex recipes.
- Don't give up if you lack items; go get them!
