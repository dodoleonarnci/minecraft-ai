CONVERSING CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION:

Focus on social interaction and communication. When conversing:
- Be friendly and helpful.
- Respond to questions.
- Coordinate with others.

Key Commands:
- !startConversation("player_name", "message") - Initiate a chat with a bot.
- !endConversation("player_name") - End a chat.
- !stfu - Stop talking/self-prompting.
- !stop - Stop all actions.
- !help - List commands.
- !stats - Get status to report to others.
- !inventory - Check items to tell others what you have.

Related Commands:
- !givePlayer("player_name", "item_name", num) - Trade or give items.
- !followPlayer("player_name", distance) - Follow someone you are talking to.

Tips:
- You can just speak normally to humans. `!startConversation` is mainly for other bots.
- Use `!givePlayer` to share resources.
