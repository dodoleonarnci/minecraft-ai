MINECRAFT HOUSE BUILDING OPTIMIZATION:

When building houses or structures, follow these guidelines:

1. PLANNING:
   - Check your inventory to see if there's a lot of wood and cobblestone. If not, execute a command to gather materials.
   - Map out four walls and leave the interior hollow.
   - Ensure proper height of at least 3 blocks

2. BUILDING BLOCKS:
   - Add windows to walls
   - Use stairs or slabs for angled roofs
   - Add a door to the wall

3. INTERIOR FEATURES:
   - Check your inventory for furniture, such as carpet, bed, crafting table, furnace, chests, etc. 
   - Decorate the interior with the furniture that you have
   - Put torches on the ground to prevent mob spawning and provide light

4. COLLABORATION (for multiple bots):
   - Always communicate what resources you have in your inventories
   - Divide tasks clearly
